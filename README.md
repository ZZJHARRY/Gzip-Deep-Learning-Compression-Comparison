A Comparative Study of Compression-Based Text Classification Against Deep Neural Network

**Authors: Zijian Zhang, Yiming Wang, Peiling Yu, Yunjie Qu**

Text classification is one of the most classic topics in the field of natural language processing. Nowadays, researchers usually utilize deep neural networks (DNN) to work on this topic. However, it could be time and resource-consuming to apply DNN in some cases. Nevertheless, there is a novel method to use the combination of gzip compression and K-NN algorithm for text classification. Itâ€™s lightweight, and there is no need to pre-train or fine-tune the model. In this project, we performed a comparative study on both compressor-based and DNN models to perform text classification.
